# Wellnote

*There is an deniable stigma surrounding the idea of going to therapy.*

It's almost as if therapy is reserved for a small part of the population and is only for people who suffer from major mental health issues. The truth is, therapy should be as acceptable as any other doctor's appointment. Physical and mental health go hand in hand at maintaining an overall well-being of a person. 

That's why we created WellNote as an application to create a seamless experience in mental well-being. By designing a video and audio journaling platform where users are encouraged to self-reflect, the AI-driven analytics engine is able to detect unusual emotional patterns and perform sentiment analysis to supplement the user's understanding of the self. 

This project utilized forefront technologies such as the Affectiva computer vision SDK and the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, and was presented as a front-end web development project using React and HTML/CSS. Google Firebase and MongoDB Atlas/Stitch was also used to support additional services and client-database communication. 

This project was originally conceived at DeltaHacks VI 2020, and won Best Health Hack and Best MongoDB Hack.
